\begin{abstract}
  This project will focus on the \#2SAT area and will design a complete computer validation of that thesis for a specific thesis. Since papers in this field rarely explain the reasoning process in detail, it is even more difficult to share codes that reproduce it. That's why it's essential to produce a complete computer verification. This project will replicate the recursive logic in the thesis by simulating the workflow of an oracle machine through computer code, thus verifying the correctness of the thesis results.

\section{Introduction}
First, the project will design a computer validation process of Magnus Wahlström's work in 2004.\cite{10.1016/j.tcs.2004.10.037} This project will focus on the \#2-SAT area of the algorithm domain, which will be covered in detail later in this introduction.

Most algorithm designs are algorithm designs for decision problems. For example, to find a solution that makes a Boolean formula satisfying. By finding a satisfying answer to a Boolean expression, we mean that given an arbitrary Boolean expression, such as $A \vee B $, one of the solutions that can make its result to be true if A is true, and B is true. This is the SAT question in the algorithmic field. SAT is the first issue that was demonstrated to be NP-complete.\cite{10.1145/800157.805047} As we all know, P-class is a fundamental complexity class that is verifiable by a deterministic Turing machine. However, NP is a generalization of P, which the lesson of choice problems decidable by a non-deterministic Turing machine that runs in polynomial time. A decisive question that is NP-complete means that it is complete for NP, which means that any question that is NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time.

Let us go back to the SAT problem. Going further, we will not only be content to find out if we can satisfy a particular Boolean expression, but we are trying to find out exactly how many solutions can satisfy that expression. This is the \#SAT question, brought up by Valiant in 1979.\cite{10.1016/0304-3975(79)90044-6} Valiant, meanwhile, raised the issue that this is a \#P-complete.

To find the final solution to a complete Boolean expression, we split out each of the propositional variables. Each propositional variable can contain either true or false. We define a literal to denote both a propositional variable x and its negation ¬x. A disjunction of literals is defined as a clause. And a conjunctive nurmal form, short for CNF, is a conjunction of clauses.

So we can represent some special case SAT questions, such as if each clause contains at most 2 literals, then we call this formula a 2-SAT formula. A more general representation is that if each clause contains at most no more than k literals in a hypothetical CNF, then we call it a k\-SAT formula (k>0). The \#2-SAT question of concern for this project can then be expressed as: how many possible solutions are there to make the formula satisfy a maximum of 2 liters per clause in any given proposed formula. Take for example the following.

\begin{align*}  
\left ( x_{0}\vee x_{1} \right )\wedge \left ( x_{1}\vee x_{2} \right )\wedge \left ( x_{2}\vee  x_{3} \right )\wedge \left ( x_{4}\right )
\end{align*}


Since we cannot give specific conclusions for all Boolean expressions, and indeed it is impossible, in this research area, we usually design a computational model to calculate the time complexity O of this model method. The time complexity usually describes the running time of an algorithm in a worst-case scenario. Computational models get different results in many branches, and we usually verify the worst time complexity to determine the time complexity of this algorithm.

In this project, the \#2SAT algorithm is explored from the initial upper bound of $ O\left ( 2^{n} \right )$, as proposed by Dubois, Zhang, Littman, and Dahllöf\cite{10.1007/3-540-45655-4_57} et al. The scheme is continuously optimized to propose $ O\left ( 1.3247^{n} \right )$, until this paper we forced uses the computer-verified work of Magnus Wahlström, who accelerated the algorithmic model of \#2SAT to $ O\left ( 1.2561^{n} \right )$ in 2004\cite{10.1016/j.tcs.2004.10.037}.

However, research in this field is purely theoretical, and the literature and papers are full of mathematical expressions and model reasoning. Papers in this field do not usually provide a specific computer code reproduction process for the given model, a process that is often hidden in the deductions of formulas, and it is difficult for later readers to rely solely on this paper to reproduce the full process of deductions. Moreover, as the theoretical research progresses, the inability to replicate the work of previously distinguished practitioners will have a very significant impact on subsequent research.

So an experimental replication of the reasoning process in this area of research will be very necessary. This is not only an experimental corroboration of the important theories of previous distinguished contributors but also an important reference for future continuing researchers in the field.

The project will be conducted based on the reading and validation of the thesis, which involves the validation of the different branches of Wahlström's work. (See Gantt chart). The initial design will be organized into a brief thesis validation report in the form of an algorithmic code design ensemble and proof draft, followed by specific code writing and validation.

As for the software required, python and related computing packages will be selected for this project because of the simplicity and ease of writing python. Due to the special nature of this project, the project does not require the operational efficiency of a complete project, only the verification of results, and therefore python has the advantage over c and java. The latest version of 3.8.2 will be chosen because the project will provide as much as possible a reasonable interpretation of previous outstanding work for future researchers in the field, so choosing the latest version of python will avoid creating a gap for future readers. As for the hardware part, since this project is a reproduction of a theoretical research example, there are no special hardware equipment requirements, just a computer that can run python.


\section{Page Size and Columns}
On each page your material should fit within a rectangle of 7 $\times$
9.15 inches (18 $\times$ 23.2 cm), centered on a US Letter page (8.5
$\times$ 11 inches), beginning 0.85 inches (1.9 cm) from the top of
the page, with a 0.3 inches (0.85 cm) space between two 3.35 inches
(8.4 cm) columns. Right margins should be justified, not
ragged. Please be sure your document and PDF are US letter and not A4.

\section{Typeset Text}
The styles contained in this document have been modified from the
default styles to reflect ACM formatting conventions. For example,
content paragraphs like this one are formatted using the Normal style.

\LaTeX\ sometimes will create overfull lines that extend into columns.
To attempt to combat this, the \texttt{.cls} file has a command,
\texttt{{\textbackslash}sloppy}, that essentially asks \LaTeX\ to
prefer underfull lines with extra whitespace.  For more details on
this, and info on how to control it more finely, check out
{\url{http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/PMAKEUP.HTM}}.

\subsection{Title and Authors}

Your paper's title, authors and affiliations should run across the
full width of the page in a single column 17.8 cm (7 in.) wide.  The
title should be in Helvetica or Arial 18-point bold.  Authors' names
should be in Times New Roman or Times Roman 12-point bold, and
affiliations in 12-point regular.  

See \texttt{{\textbackslash}author} section of this template for
instructions on how to format the authors. For more than three
authors, you may have to place some address information in a footnote,
or in a named section at the end of your paper. Names may optionally
be placed in a single centered row instead of at the top of each
column. Leave one 10-point line of white space below the last line of
affiliations.

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of Author Keywords and ACM Classification
Keywords. The abstract and keywords should be placed in the left
column of the first page under the left half of the title. The
abstract should be a concise statement of the problem, approach, and
conclusions of the work described. It should clearly state the paper's
contribution to the field of HCI\@.

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}

Please use a 10-point Times New Roman or Times Roman font or, if this
is unavailable, another proportional font with serifs, as close as
possible in appearance to Times Roman 10-point. Other than Helvetica
or Arial headings, please use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts
only for special purposes, such as source code text.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}
This template include a sample ACM copyright notice at the bottom of
page 1, column 1.  Upon acceptance, you will be provided with the
appropriate copyright statement and unique DOI string for publication.
Accepted papers will be distributed in the conference
publications. They will also be placed in the ACM Digital Library,
where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and
practitioners worldwide. See
\url{http://acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy} for the
ACM's copyright and permissions policy.

\subsection{Subsequent Pages}

On pages beyond the first, start at the top of the page and continue
in double-column format.  The two columns on the last page should be
of equal length.

    Caption style.  One-line captions should be centered; multi-line
    should be justified. }~\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by last name of first author, and referenced by numbers
in
brackets~\cite{acm_categories,ethics,Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378}.
Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Borriello, personal communication]'').

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}. This
includes citations to internet
resources~\cite{acm_categories,cavender:writing,CHINOSAUR:venue,psy:gangnam}
according to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include
URLs directly in the text, as above.

\end{table}

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold,
all in capitals. Sections should \textit{not} be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point bold
with initial letters capitalized.  For sub-sections and
sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of} is not
capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica or Arial 9-point
italic with initial letters capitalized.  Standard
\texttt{{\textbackslash}section}, \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsection},
and \texttt{{\textbackslash}subsubsection} commands will work fine in
this template.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text (see
Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.75\columnwidth]{figures/map}
  \caption{In this image, the map maximizes use of space. You can make
    figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of
    both columns. Note that \LaTeX\ tends to render large figures on a
    dedicated page. Image: \ccbynd~ayman on
    Flickr.}~\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure*}

Captions should be Times New Roman or Times Roman 9-point bold.  They
should be numbered (e.g., ``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or
``Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}''), centered and placed beneath the figure
or table.  Please note that the words ``Figure'' and ``Table'' should
be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure'' rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they
occur. Figures, like Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}, may span columns and
all figures should also include alt text for improved accessibility.
Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in
the proceedings.

The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure up to five
minutes in length. However, the paper should stand on its own without
the video figure, as the video may not be available to everyone who
reads the paper.  

\subsection{Inserting Images}
When possible, include a vector formatted graphic (i.e. PDF or EPS).
When including bitmaps,  use an image editing tool to resize the image
at the appropriate printing resolution (usually 300 dpi).

\section{Quotations}
Quotations may be italicized when \textit{``placed inline''} (Anab,
23F).

\begin{quote}
Longer quotes, when placed in their own paragraph, need not be
italicized or in quotation marks when indented (Ramon, 39M).  
\end{quote}

\section{Language, Style, and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consis- tently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text---e.g., ``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1--5--97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the
  \textit{Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal
  attributes~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}. Be particularly aware of
  considerations around writing about people with disabilities.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Add tags to the PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see: \url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}.  The
\texttt{{\textbackslash}hyperref} package allows you to create well tagged PDF files,
please see the preamble of this template for an example.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission should not contain footer or header information
at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, your final submission
should not include page numbers. Initial submissions may include page
numbers, but these must be removed for camera-ready. Page numbers will
be added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.

When creating your PDF from Word, ensure that you generate a tagged
PDF from improved accessibility. This can be done by using the Adobe
PDF add-in, also called PDFMaker. Select Acrobat | Preferences from
the ribbon and ensure that ``Enable Accessibility and Reflow with
tagged Adobe PDF'' is selected. You can then generate a tagged PDF by
selecting ``Create PDF'' from the Acrobat ribbon.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years' proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.
