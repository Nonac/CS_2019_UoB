  abstract = {{We present a polynomial-space algorithm that computes the number independent sets of any input graph in time \$O(1.1387\textasciicircumn)\$ for graphs with maximum degree 3 and in time \$O(1.2355\textasciicircumn)\$ for general graphs, where n is the number of vertices. Together with the inclusion-exclusion approach of Bj\textbackslash"orklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto [SIAM J. Comput. 2009], this leads to a faster polynomial-space algorithm for the graph coloring problem with running time \$O(2.2355\textasciicircumn)\$. As a byproduct, we also obtain an exponential-space \$O(1.2330\textasciicircumn)\$ time algorithm for counting independent sets. Our main algorithm counts independent sets in graphs with maximum degree 3 and no vertex with three neighbors of degree 3. This polynomial-space algorithm is analyzed using the recently introduced Separate, Measure and Conquer approach [Gaspers \& Sorkin, ICALP 2015]. Using Wahlstr\textbackslash"om's compound measure approach, this improvement in running time for small degree graphs is then bootstrapped to larger degrees, giving the improvement for general graphs. Combining both approaches leads to some inflexibility in choosing vertices to branch on for the small-degree cases, which we counter by structural graph properties.}},

  title = {{Counting independent sets via Divide Measure and Conquer method}}, 
  eprint = {1503.08323}, 
  abstract = {{In this paper we give an algorithm for counting the number of all independent sets in a given graph which works in time \$O\textasciicircum*(1.1394\textasciicircumn)\$ for subcubic graphs and in time \$O\textasciicircum*(1.2369\textasciicircumn)\$ for general graphs, where \$n\$ is the number of vertices in the instance graph, and polynomial space. The result comes from combining two well known methods "Divide and Conquer" and "Measure and Conquer". We introduce this new concept of Divide, Measure and Conquer method and expect it will find applications in other problems. The algorithm of Bj\textbackslash"orklund, Husfeldt and Koivisto for graph colouring with our algorithm used as a subroutine has complexity \$O\textasciicircum*(2.2369\textasciicircumn)\$ and is currently the fastest graph colouring algorithm in polynomial space.}},

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.}},

In this paper, we discuss a new data structure for storing and manipulating sets of strings, called Sequence Binary Decision Diagrams (sequence BDDs), which has recently been introduced by Loekito et al. (2010) as a descendant of both acyclic DFAs (ADFAs) and binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Sequence BDDs can compactly represent sets of sequences similarly to minimal ADFAs, and allow efficient set operations inherited from BDDs. We study fundamental properties of sequence BDDs, such as the characterization of minimal sequence BDDs by reduced sequence BDDs, non-trivial relationships between sizes of minimal sequence BDDs and minimal ADFAs, the complexities of minimization, Boolean set operations, and sequence BDD construction. We also show experimental results for real and artificial data sets.}},

Given a set of m clauses on n propositional variables, where each clause contains at most two literals and is weighted by a positive real, MAX-2-SAT asks to find a truth assignment that maximizes the total weight of satisfied clauses. In this paper, we propose branch-and-bound exact algorithms for MAX-2-SAT utilizing three kinds of lower bounds. All lower bounds are based on a directed graph that represents conflicts among clauses, and two of them use a set covering representation of MAX-2-SAT. Computational comparisons on benchmark instances disclose that these algorithms are highly effective in reducing the number of search tree nodes as well as the computation time.}},

In order to prove these time bounds, we develop new measures of formula complexity, allowing us to conveniently analyze the effects of certain factors with a large impact on the total running time.
